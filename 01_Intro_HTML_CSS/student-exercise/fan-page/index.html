        <h2>Background on Prince</h2>
            
            <p>

                Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 7, 1958, the son of jazz singer Mattie Della (n√©e Shaw) and pianist and songwriter John Lewis Nelson. All four of his grandparents hailed from Louisiana.
                Prince was given his father's stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while performing with his mother in a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince's father told A Current Affair that he named
                his son Prince because he wanted Prince "to do everything I wanted to do". Prince was not fond of his name and wanted people to instead call him Skipper, a name which stuck throughout his childhood. Prince said he was 
                "born epileptic" and had seizures when he was young. He stated, "My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said, 'Why?' and I said, 'Because an angel told me so. 
                Prince's younger sister, Tyka, was born on May 18, 1960. Both siblings developed a keen interest in music, which was encouraged by their father. His parents were members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, an evangelical denomination.

                People will always have their opinions. Only you know who you really are.  Focus on living authentically
                and honestly, have integrity in all that you do, and those opinions won't matter.

                People who have no creativity, talent, or courage are those who follow the rules.  Be brave, be bold, step up
                and make your own!  The passion that lies inside of yo means you do not need to follow the pack, because you
                transcend it.
